Everything’s been said  
But one last thing about the desert,  
And it’s awful: During brush fires in the Sonoran desert,  
Brush fires that happen before the monsoon and in the great,  
Deep, wide, and smothering heat of the hottest months,  
The longest months,  
The hypnotic, immeasurable lulls of August and July—  
During these summer fires, jackrabbits—  
Jackrabbits and everything else  
That lives in the brush of the rolling hills,  
But jackrabbits especially—  
Jackrabbits can get caught in the flames,  
No matter how fast and big and strong and sleek they are.  
And when they’re caught,  
Cornered in and against the thick  
Trunks and thin spines of the cactus,  
When they can’t back up any more,  
When they can’t move, the flame—  
It touches them,  
And their fur catches fire.
